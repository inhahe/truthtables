Input names of three truth tables/operators x, y, z and prints the name of the table/operator which is x y'd with z.

Good luck if you can figuree out how this works, I don't remember.

Nor do I know of any point to using this program. I just made it as a curiosity.

example:

<pre>
D:\py>truthtables.py

&lt;logic gate> &lt;operator> &lt;logic gate>: and or nor
nxand
</pre>

You can look inside the source to see the names used for all the possible truth tables.
