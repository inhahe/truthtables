Input the names of three truth tables/operators X, Y, and Z, and it'll spit out the name of the table/operator which is X Y'd with Z.

Good luck trying to figure out how this works, I don't remember.

Nor do I know of any point to using this program. I just made it as a curiosity.

example:

<pre>
D:\py>truthtables.py

&lt;logic gate> &lt;operator> &lt;logic gate>: and or nor
nxand
</pre>

You can look inside the source to see the names used for all the possible truth tables.

truthtables.notes.py (not entirely actually Python code) contains a lot of cryptic notes I wrote while programming it as well as some alternative definitions for the names of the truth tables.
